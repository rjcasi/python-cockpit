# Python Cockpit Demos

Welcome to the **Python Cockpit**, a modular collection of demos showcasing skills in physics simulation, data scraping, and networking. Each demo is plug‑and‑play, automatically detected and launched via `src/main.py`.

## Setup
git clone https://github.com/rjcasi/python-cockpit.git
cd python-cockpit
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


---

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd python-cockpit
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py

- **Explainable AI** → Visualize attention maps and tensor hierarchies.

---

### 🛡️ Cybersecurity Panel
- **Fuzzing Lab** → Symbolic agent that defends against its own fuzzing patterns.  
- **Bug Bounty Automation** → Web bots and spiders for vulnerability scanning.  
- **Red/Blue Cockpit** → Ethical hacking dashboards with attack/defense simulations.

---

### ⛓️ Blockchain & Cryptography Panel
- **Wallet Simulation** → Showcase cryptographic primitives and transaction flows.  
- **Consensus Algorithms** → Visualize proof‑of‑work vs proof‑of‑stake.  
- **Secure Messaging** → End‑to‑end encryption demos.

---

### 🧠 Neuroscience‑Inspired Panel
- **Spiking Neurons with STDP** → Multi‑level neuron models with adaptive learning.  
- **Attention Tensor** → Biologically inspired directional sound‑based attention.  
- **Phase Space Visualizations** → Density, flow, and energy mapped into cockpit panels.
